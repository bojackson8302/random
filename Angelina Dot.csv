Davidson Park,"At 938 feet, Mt. Davidson is the highest point in San Francisco. Its most noticeable feature, aside from its height, is the 103-foot concrete cross at its peak. Seen from above, there is a clear division between the mountain's eucalyptus forest on the west and coastal scrub and grassland on the east. Mt. Davidson has significant natural and recreational resources. The diversity of vegetation provides habitat for a wide range of migratory and resident birds, including 18 locally sensitive species. Myriad trails traverse the western slopes, where the densely overgrown vegetation and fog drip give a hiker the feeling of being in a rainforest.","Myriad trails traverse the western slopes, where the densely overgrown vegetation and fog drip give a hiker the feeling of being in a rainforest.","Myra Way San Francisco, CA 94127 Phone: (415) 831-6331",1.85,San Francisco,California,Twin Peaks Park,"At 922 feet in elevation, Twin Peaks is second only to Mt.

Smaller rodents such as voles urinate almost continuously, so a kestrel can simply follow the fresh trail directly to its prey.",Billy Goat Hill has a small trail network consisting of 0.2 miles.
